# Privacy policy

installguard-copilot is a GitHub Copilot CLI plugin written by Gary Riches. This page says what data it handles. It applies to installguard-copilot as published at https://github.com/griches/installguard-copilot.

## What leaves your machine

When Copilot is about to install a package your project does not already have, installguard-copilot asks that package's public registry about it. The request contains the package's name, and its version when you pinned one. Nothing else is sent.

| Host | Asked for |
| --- | --- |
| `registry.npmjs.org` | An npm package's version, publish dates, install scripts and deprecation |
| `api.npmjs.org` | An npm package's weekly downloads |
| `pypi.org` | A PyPI package's releases and their dates |
| `pypistats.org` | A PyPI package's weekly downloads |
| `crates.io` | A crate's versions, dates and recent downloads |
| `rubygems.org` | A gem's versions and dates |
| `api.deps.dev` | The publish date of one npm version you pinned, when the package is too large to ask npm for it |

Four of these are the registries your package manager contacts when it installs the package. `api.npmjs.org` and `pypistats.org` are the services that publish download counts for npm and PyPI. `api.deps.dev` is Google's Open Source Insights, which mirrors npm's release dates. Each one sees the request as it would see any other, including your IP address, and handles it under its own privacy policy.

A registry is asked only about a package named in a command that is about to run, or one you look up yourself with `/installguard check`.

## What never leaves your machine

- Your conversation with Copilot.
- Your code and your files.
- The commands Copilot runs.
- The contents of `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml` and `Gemfile`, which are read only to see which packages you already depend on.

## What is stored

Kept on your machine, in `~/.copilot/installguard/`, and never sent anywhere:

- `allowed.json`: the packages you chose to always allow. Cleared with `/installguard forget`.
- `log.jsonl`: the last few hundred checks, each with the command that was checked and what the registry said. Delete the file to clear it.
- `config.json`: your settings, if you wrote any.
- `root`: the folder the plugin is installed in.

## What installguard-copilot does not do

- It has no server of its own and no account.
- It collects no analytics, telemetry or crash reports.
- It calls no AI model.
- The author receives no data from it of any kind.
